# Cypress Storybook Commands

## Workspace

This repo contains a cypress and storybook sandbox for the development of the `cypress-storybook-commands` plugin.

For plugin usage [view the package documentation](packages/cypress-storybook-commands/README.md)

For contributing to this plugin continue reading below.

## Modifying the plugin

Code is found in `packages/cypress-storybook-commands` and can be tested via the `sandbox/cypress` instance. A storybook instance is also provided in `sandbox/storybook` but you can run against any instance by modifying the `baseUrl` in the cypress setup.
